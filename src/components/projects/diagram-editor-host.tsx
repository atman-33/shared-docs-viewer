 *
 * The Docs tab reuses this for diagram files (T-1000) with `readOnly`: the
 * same view, frozen — reading only, no edit UI brought along.
 *
 * Only the view matching `kind` is mounted — never all nine. The view owns
 * its debounced save; the host adds nothing to it. `locked` stays false
 * (there is no AI runner on this side, so nothing takes the lock),
 * `reloadToken` stays 0 (external edits arrive through the file watcher the
 * views already listen to), and the side panel starts open, like a freshly
 * opened note. `onPathChange("")` means the note is gone — a delete or a move
 * elsewhere — so the pane lets go of it.
 *
 * The view is keyed by `path`: switching notes remounts it, so a note never
 * inherits the previous note's model, file text, mtime or queued save (T-0858).
 *
 * The parent gives this its height (`min-h-0 flex-1`); the view fills it with
 * `h-full`, so no page-level scroll appears.
